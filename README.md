Virtual Herbal Garden
Description
Virtual Herbal Garden is an interactive web application designed to educate users about medicinal plants used in Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. The website features a visually appealing interface with a sticky navigation bar, smooth animations, and a scrolling credits section to showcase the development team. It includes pages for exploring plants, viewing a gallery, and contacting the team, enhanced with audio effects for hover interactions and ambient rain sounds.
This project is ideal for herbal medicine enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in natural remedies.
